# About geopard
Geopard is a gtk3 gemini client

## Some notable features
- Colors! 
  The browser will have a different color for each domain you visit.

- Fast (async core + caching).
  Streams content by default. That means you can open pages even when you have
  connection speeds of Kb/s.
  It also caches pages in the history, so you can go back in an instant
        

- Can download binary files.
  The download will start as soon as you open the corresponding link.
  You can always cancel it by opening another page.

- It works. Until I find another bug

## Technical details
Under the hood, it uses gtk3 and rust. Everything related to IO is asynchronous.
To do that, it makes use of rust async/await capabilities and the async-std crate.

# How to change settings
You should find the configuration file in ~/.config/geopard/config.toml
