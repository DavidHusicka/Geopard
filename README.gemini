# About geopard
Geopard is a gtk4 gemini client

## Some notable features
- Colors! 
  The browser will have a different color for each domain you visit.

- Fast (async core + caching).
  Streams content by default. That means you can open pages even when you have
  connection speeds of Kb/s.
  It also caches pages in the history, so you can go back/forward in an instant
        

- Can download binary files.
  The download will start as soon as you open the corresponding link.
  You can always cancel it by opening another page.

- It works. Until I find another bug

## Technical details
Under the hood, it uses gtk4 and rust. Everything related to IO is asynchronous.
To do that, it makes use of rust async/await capabilities and the async-std crate.

# How to change settings
You should find the configuration files in ~/.config/geopard/
If you use flatpak, they are in ~/.var/app/com.ranfdev.Geopard/config/geopard/.
In the future I will probably introduce a settings GUI.

## How to build
### With Flatpak
If you have gnome-builder installed, use it to the open the folder of the source
code and hit the run button.

### Build with Nix
** currently broken **
If you have the 
=> https://nixos.org/ nix
package manager, you can simply do:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ranfdev/Geopard.git
nix-build nix/default.nix
./result/bin/geopard
```

### General build instructions
Clone this repo.

Install these development packages:
- gtk4
- glib
- rust (with cargo)
- openssl
- pkg-config

Then you can compile and run.
```sh
cargo build
./target/release/geopard
```
